# README

If you were looking for starting point with Rails (6) and Trailblazer 2.1, you are in the right place!

This example project contains

* CRUD with TRB2.

    * Operations

    * Cells

    * Reform

* Slim

* Webpacked assets

    * SCSS

* Bootstrap

* Coming soon

    * Devise & basic user management
    
    * TRB Policies
    
    
## Kickstart
It should be as easy (not guaranteed) as:
* checkout the project
* set your ruby env, e.g. with rvm: ruby 2.7.1 & rails 6.0.3.1
```
bundle install
rails db:create
rails db:migrate
yarn install
```
It is quite easy to find time-consuming problems which need to be solved with correct gem version 'golden' combination. One point of this example project is to help you over these problems, so I recommend holding on the lock file and updating gems carefully.
